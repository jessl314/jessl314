## Hi there, Welcome to My Github! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jessica Liao and I am a current second-year Computer Science Major at UCI. I love to learn and have become proficient in Python, C++ and most recently React! Outside of classes, I have collaborated on a project in Video Game Development Club, I am a Logistics Organizer for Venushacks and so much more!  

For fun, I like to read, watch tv, crochet and try new foods (I also really like boba!)  

I'm currently learning web development outside of academics!
